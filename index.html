                SHAKSHUKA
            </h2>
            <p>
                It’s really easy to make shakshuka, especially if you use canned tomatoes (though you can always use fresh tomatoes as well). Dice an onion and red bell pepper and add that to a sauté pan with a little olive oil on medium heat. Stir the veggies for about 5 minutes or until the onions become translucent.

                Then add the garlic and spices and stir for another minute until they’re nice and fragrant. Pour in a 28-ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes and use your spatula to break up the tomatoes into smaller pieces. Once this entire mixture is lightly simmering, you can crack your eggs on top.
                Use your spatula to make little holes for the eggs, then crack an egg into each hole. I used 6 eggs, though depending on the size of your pan you may use more or less. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and cook for another 5-8 minutes or until the eggs are done to your liking.

                Before serving, season the eggs with salt and a generous amount of freshly chopped parsley and cilantro. Enjoy!

                PICKLED RED ONIONS
            </h2>
            <p>
                Unlike other fermented foods (that could take days), these onions are pickled in in just one hour! That’s why they’re quick pickled red onions! I like to pickle them in a 16-ounce mason jar, but any medium-sized container will work.
                Slice the onions. You can use either a knife or a mandoline, just make sure to slice into thin pieces. This will make it easier for the onions to absorb the vinegar. Then place them into the mason jar.
                Make the brine. In a small saucepan over medium-heat, warm up the water, vinegar, honey, and salt. Stir it all together, let it simmer for about 1 minute, then turn off the heat.
                Let the fermenting begin! Carefully pour the brine into the jar and let it stand at room temperature until slightly cooled. Then cover and refrigerate. They’ll be ready to eat after about an hour in the fridge (though I like to wait overnight), or will keep for 2 to 3 weeks!

                GRILLED CORN ON THE COB
            </h2>
            <p>
                WITH THE HUSK
Get grilling: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Place the corn on the grill (no need to soak in water), close the grill, and cook for about 15 minutes, while rotating every 5 minutes or so.
Remove and shuck the corn: Remove the corn from the grill with tongs, let cool to the touch, the remove the husk and silks.
Butter them up: Brush on melted butter (or add a pat of butter), and sprinkle with salt and pepper before serving.
